# About
A web server for generating subsequences

# Motivation
There currently does not exist an easy and automatic way to generate subsequences of the entirety of the human microRNA spectrum. As a result, finding unique motifs to use in non-alignment approach based microRNA analyses is extremely tedious. To help scientists find unique subsequences of human microRNAs to develop motif lists, I developed this web-app (compatible with QuagmiR, a microRNA analysis tool).

# Quickstart
Visit the link below and just
- (1) Enter in how many NT (Nucleotides) you want the motif to be from the 5p side (recommended 3-4)
- (2) Enter in your desired motif size (will need to increase depending on how big the motif list is. ~100 miRNA can handle a motif size of 10 reasonably well)
- (3) Enter in a list of desired microRNA that you want to generate motifs for (a link is provided below the input box of all human miRNA)
- (4) Hit generate
